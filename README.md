# Powershell-Portscanner
A simple interactive portscanner for powershell that supports lists and CIDR.

Just execute it and write type the IP address, or the list of IP address that
you'd want to verify for open ports. Or type the ip address in CIDR notation for
scanning subnets.

Don't forget to separate the IP addresses and the ports by spaces.
Example:
(IPs: '''192.168.0.1 192.168.0.2 192.168.0.3''').
(Ports: '''22 23 80 443''').
